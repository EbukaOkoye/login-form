# Description

This is a project with a combination of HTML, CSS and javascript. The aim of this project is to save the password and the email handle of the user to local storage of the browser. The project was aimed at imitating the add to cart function of most e-commerce websites. While creating the UI of the webpage, there were some challenges in adding the local storage function with the javascript. I had to consult stack-overflow for help. One thing i learned in this project is how to make research and consult other sources.
